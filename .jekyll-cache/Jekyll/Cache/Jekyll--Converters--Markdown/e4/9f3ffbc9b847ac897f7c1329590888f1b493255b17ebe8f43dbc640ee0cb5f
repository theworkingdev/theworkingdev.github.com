I"¼<p>Before diving into Android programming, there are a couple of skills you might want to look at. It is possible to simply jump into programming, build some basic screens by copying example codes from the internet or from other programmers. But you cannot go to the deep end. When you find yourself neckdeep in the not-so-trivial parts of Android programming and you feel stuck, thatâ€™s probably because you havenâ€™t covered some bases.</p>
