I"|<p>In Java, if we needed to add functionality to a class, we could either add methods to the class itself or extend it by inheritance. An extension function in Kotlin allows to add behavior to an existing class, including the ones written in Java, without using inheritance. We can define additional behavior for an existing class and do the definition outside of that class.</p>
