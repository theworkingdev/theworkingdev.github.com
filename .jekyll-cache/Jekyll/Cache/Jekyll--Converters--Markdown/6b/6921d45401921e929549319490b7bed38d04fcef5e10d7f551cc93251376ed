<p>When you encounter an adb server out of date in a Linux environment, that might be because there’s more than one location in your machine where the Android tools are installed. This error happened to me on a Lubuntu 15, while I was using Genymotion (for the emulator) and Android Studio (for the IDE).</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>. Cannot connect to adb server via the command line. Simple commands like <code class="highlighter-rouge">adb devices</code> produces the out of date error</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adb server is out of date.  killing...
cannot <span class="nb">bind</span> <span class="s1">'tcp:5037'</span>
ADB server didn<span class="s1">'t ACK
* failed to start daemon *
error:
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h3>

<p><strong>Do not use the Genymotion SDK</strong>. When you launch genymotion, go to “Settings” then “ADB”. Choose “Use custom SDK” then provide the path to your android sdk.</p>

<p><strong>Remove any android-tools</strong> that may have been installed on your machine. You can check if the adb tool shows up on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> which adb 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If it shows up in a place other than /path-to/android-sdk/platform-tools, then you might have a copy of adb that is not part of the android sdk distribution.</p>

<p>You can try to remove the non-sdk copy of adb, perhaps using</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get purge android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can simply navigate to the directory of your android-sdk and invoke the adb command directly from there.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /path-to/android-sdk/platform-tools/
./adb services
./adb shell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember to replace <strong>/path-to/android-sdk/</strong> with your own path to the android sdk. If you are using the sdk that came with an Android Studio installation, chances are, the sdk is located <strong>/home/your_username/Android/Sdk</strong>. So use the following command</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd 
cd </span>Android/Sdk/platform-tools/
./adb services
./adb shell 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That should fix it.</p>
