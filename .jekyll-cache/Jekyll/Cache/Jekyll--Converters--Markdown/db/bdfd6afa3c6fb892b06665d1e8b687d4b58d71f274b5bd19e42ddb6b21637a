I"È<p>Docco is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style documentation generator. It produces HTML that displays your comments alongside your code. It can be used to generate documentation for JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Python and Ruby. But it wonâ€™t work for Java source files. There are ports of this script so that it can work with other languages, including Java, some prominent projects are Jocco and Marginalia (for Clojure).</p>
