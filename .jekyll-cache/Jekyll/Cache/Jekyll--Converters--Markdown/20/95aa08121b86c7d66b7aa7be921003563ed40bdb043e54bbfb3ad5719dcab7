I"¦<p>Like most challenges that I took, I know that I wonâ€™t be able to do this challenge consistently everyday. But here goes the #100dayMLchallenge. This is my day 1.</p>

<p>What I did. Watched the 100dayMLchallenge vid (Siraj Raval, Learn Machine Learning in 3 months). Also I completed the David Chapellâ€™s â€œUnderstanding Machine Learningâ€, Pluralsight.</p>

<p>My take away is;.</p>

<em>Machine learning process</em></p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Choose the data you want to work with. In this process, domain experts are involved. These are the people who know a lot about their domain e.g. credit card fraud. But these data arenâ€™t ready yet. They have duplicates and probably not in the format that you need them; so you do the next thing, which is;</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Scrub or clean the data, this process is also called pre-processing.</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> This is the result of pre-processing. Youâ€™ll often go back to pre-processing until youâ€™re satisfied with the â€œcleanlinessâ€ of the data. When you think itâ€™s already in the format you need, you can proceed to the next step; which is</p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong> To apply a learning algorithm. Machine learning packages often includes these algorithms. This is not yet the algorithm of your application. This algorithm is applied to the prepared data so you can produce a model</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong> a candidate model is what youâ€™ll get when you apply learning algorithms to the data. But often, this is not the final model. Event this process is iterative. Youâ€™ll often go back to â€œapplying learning algorithmâ€ to your data until you are satisfied with the model</p>

<p><strong>(6)</strong> The chosen model is the result of iterating over â€œapplying a learning algorithmâ€</p>

<p><strong>(7)</strong> This is your application</p>

<p><strong>(8)</strong> This is your output</p>
