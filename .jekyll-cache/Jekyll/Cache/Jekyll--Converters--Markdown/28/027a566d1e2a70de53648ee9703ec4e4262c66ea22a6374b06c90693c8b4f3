I"¾<p>In Google I/O 2017, Google announced Kotlin support for Android Studio 3. Kotlin is now an official language to build Android Apps. I wrote Learn Android Studio 3 for Apress in 2017 (both Java and Kotlin editions). Those books covered multiple learning curves, it tackles the IDE, Android Programming and language basics. It takes time to go through them. I designed this book to be a very quick read.</p>

<p>More and more developers are building Android apps using Kotlin.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-book">Whatâ€™s in the book;</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A very quick tour of the Kotlin language. Chapters are short but choc-ful of codes (and explanations, of course). On the very remote chance youâ€™ve read my book before, this is written in the same spirit, it follows the same instructional design pattern. Concepts, then codes, then explanations</li>
  <li>Some chapters are devoted to setup. I used IntelliJ 2018 community edition and Android Studio 3.3 for the book examples</li>
  <li>Links to worked examples. The sample codes and projects are in Github https://github.com/tedhagos/kotlinquickbites</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="this-book-is-for-you-if">This book is for you if;</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Youâ€™re already an Android programmer, youâ€™ve been using Java and youâ€™re curious about Kotlin because your dev friends told you itâ€™s cool; you wanna see what the hype is about</li>
  <li>You have background in CFOL (C family of language, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++ and of course, C), youâ€™re curious about the newest kid in the JVM block</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re just generally curious about Kotlin</li>
</ul>
