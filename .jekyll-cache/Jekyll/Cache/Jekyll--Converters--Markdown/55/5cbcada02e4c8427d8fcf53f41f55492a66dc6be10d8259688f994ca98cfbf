I"[<p>In a few hours, I will head to Asia Pacific College to give an introductory talk about Android applications development. I haven’t been to APC for a very long time, and I haven’t talked in front of a crowd for a very long time as well, much less give an introductory talk inside an auditorium—but no matter, I think all will be well.</p>
