I"³<p>This project will let you control a music player daemon running on a Linux box. The Linux box (headphone jack) will be connected into a stereo receiver (input. Itâ€™s an over engineered music player. But if you donâ€™t have anything better to do with an old notebook, this might save it from the junk yard.</p>

<p>For this project, I used the following;</p>

<ul>
  <li>an old notebook with WiFi still working</li>
  <li>an old stereo receiver with 3.5mm stereo jack input</li>
</ul>

<p>Installation and Configuration</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the MPD (music player daemon)  â€“ sudo apt-get install mpd mpc</li>
  <li>Edit the configuration file located at /etc/mpd.conf</li>
  <li>Find the entry on the configuration file where you are supposed to point to where you music files are</li>
  <li>Save the config file</li>
  <li>Restart the Music Player Daemon â€“ sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart</li>
  <li>Create the database for the first time to add all songs to the playlist â€“ sudo mpd â€“create-db then sudo mpd add l</li>
  <li>Install MPD clients on your other computers. At the time I wrote this, I used ncmpc. Lots of things has changed since then, Wikia.com has a list of MPD clients</li>
</ol>
