I"‡<p>The Snackbar is a view thatâ€™s mostly used to give quick feedback to the user, like Toast. It appears at the bottom of the the screen and disappears after some timeout. Sometimes the user can â€œswipeâ€ the Snackbar to make it disappear. But unlike Toast, you can put some actions in the Snackbar.</p>
