I"√<p>The most visible part of Android, at least for developers, is its operating system (OS). An OS is a complex thing but for the most part, it is what stands between a user and the hardware. That is an oversimplification, but it will suffice for our purposes. By ‚Äúuser‚Äù, I don‚Äôt literally mean an end user or a person. What I mean by it is an application, a piece of code that a programmer creates, like a word processor or an email client.</p>
