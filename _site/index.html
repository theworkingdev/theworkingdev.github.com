An OS is a complex thing but for the most part, it is what stands between a user and the hardware. That is an oversimplification, but it will suffice for our purposes. By “user”, I don’t literally mean an end user or a person. What I mean by it is an application, a piece of code that a programmer creates, like a word processor or an email client.</p>

Why would we want to do that? So that UI Thread is freed up to do UI stuff like creating and updating views. Coz if we burden the UI Thread with other stuff that doesn’t concern the UI, like doing I/O work or doing complex calculations, the Android runtime will reduce the framerate of our app which will cause it behave sluggishly — in short, jank.</p>
