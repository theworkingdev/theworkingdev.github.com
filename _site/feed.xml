<p>For the last couple of years, I mostly ignored AI coding tools.</p>

<p>Not because I’m anti-AI. Not because I didn’t understand the technology. But because the early conversation was noisy. “Vibe coding.” “Replace developers.” “Just prompt your way to an app.”</p>

<p>If you’ve been building software professionally—especially in Java, maintaining services that have survived three company rebrands, and onboarding into legacy systems written by people who apparently hated their future selves—it was reasonable to sit this out.</p>

<p>Now the tools are better. The hype has cooled down. And curiosity is creeping back in. So here’s the smallest useful way to start, without changing how you think about software.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-vibe-code">You Don’t “Vibe Code”</h2>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way.</p>

<p>You don’t outsource thinking. 
You don’t paste code you didn’t read. 
You don’t treat an AI model as a senior engineer. 
You use AI where it replaces friction, not judgment.</p>

<p>That distinction matters.</p>

<h2 id="why-skipping-the-early-hype-was-reasonable">Why Skipping the Early Hype Was Reasonable</h2>

<p>Early AI tooling optimized for spectacle, not workflow. Demos over discipline. Speed over correctness. Output over ownership.</p>

<p>For those of us shipping Java services, debugging production issues, and maintaining codebases where “speed over correctness” is just another way of saying</p>

<p>“I want my pager to go off at 2:00 AM,” that was a red flag.</p>

<p>If your instinct was “I’ll wait until this is boring,” that was good engineering judgment. It’s starting to get boring now.</p>

<p>And that’s a compliment.</p>

<h2 id="one-concrete-use-case-the-second-set-of-eyes">One Concrete Use Case: The “Second Set of Eyes”</h2>

<p>Forget code generation. Start with explanation. You already spend time reading unfamiliar Java code: legacy services, old utility classes, and pull requests written by four different people—two of whom have left the company and one who apparently thought <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BigDecimal</code> was just a suggestion.</p>

<p>AI is surprisingly good at turning “I think I understand this” into “I see where the sharp edges are.”</p>

<h3 id="the-smallest-useful-workflow">The Smallest Useful Workflow</h3>

<p>Take a real method from your codebase. Paste it into your AI tool of choice and ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Explain what this method does, what assumptions it makes, and what could go wrong.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. No refactors. No rewrites. Just a system for turning a pile of ambiguous tokens into a slightly more organized pile of tokens that your brain can process without a heat-spike.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-java-service-method-nothing-fancy-just-annoying">A Real Java Service Method (Nothing Fancy, Just Annoying)</h2>

<p>Imagine you encounter this in a typical service class:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read this, but you don’t fully trust it yet. This is typical Java service-layer code: business rules embedded directly in a method, written incrementally over years.</p>

<p>When you ask the AI for blind spots, a useful explanation surfaces things you might miss when you’re tired:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Implicit assumptions</strong>: Does the discount stack? Is it expected to be between 0 and 1?</li>
  <li><strong>Edge cases</strong>: A discount value like 5 (500%) produces a negative intermediate price.</li>
  <li><strong>Design smells</strong>: Magic numbers like 0.95 and hard-coded rules that should probably be in a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>You didn’t ask the AI to fix it. You asked it to help you see the landmines faster.</p>

<h2 id="the-review-question-that-changes-things">The Review Question That Changes Things</h2>

<p>Now imagine a method like this shows up in a pull request:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">isEligibleForRefund</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">daysSinceDelivery</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
        <span class="nc">ChronoUnit</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">DAYS</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">between</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getDeliveredAt</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="nc">LocalDate</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">now</span><span class="o">());</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">daysSinceDelivery</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It passes tests. It gets merged. But a solid AI explanation surfaces the temporal coupling: using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LocalDate.now()</code> is a great way to ensure your tests fail exactly once a year during a leap day or whenever the build server’s clock drifts.</p>

<p>AI doesn’t replace the reviewer. Its job is to act as a very fast, slightly pedantic colleague who pokes you in the ribs and points at a line of code until you admit you don’t actually know what happens to that BigDecimal if the quantity is a negative prime number.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-rule-you-dont-break">The One Rule You Don’t Break</h2>
<p><strong>Never paste code you didn’t read</strong>.</p>

<p>Explanation comes after reading, not instead of it. Think of AI as a second set of eyes that never gets tired, not a brain replacement.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-is-not-the-anti-hype-list">What This Is Not (The “Anti-Hype” List)</h2>
<p>Look, I’m not talking about “vibe coding”—hoping the computer guesses what I want so I don’t have to learn how a Map works.</p>

<p>This isn’t prompt engineering, which often feels like trying to cast a magic spell by whispering specific adjectives at a server farm. It’s also not a replacement for design thinking. If you don’t know why you’re building a service, a faster way to generate NullPointerExceptions isn’t going to save you.</p>

<h2 id="why-im-opinionated-about-this">Why I’m Opinionated About This</h2>
<p>I’ve spent years writing and maintaining Java code across production systems, code reviews, and technical books for Apress. I’m not interested in replacing developers with tools. I care about workflows that hold up under maintenance, testing, and real-world constraints.</p>

<p>If a tool doesn’t make you a better reader of code, it’s not worth adopting. We have enough complexity in the JVM as it is; we don’t need to add “statistical guesswork” to the list of reasons why the 2:00 AM deployment failed.</p>

<h2 id="start-here-stop-there">Start Here. Stop There.</h2>
<p>If you’ve been late to AI coding tools, good. You skipped the worst part. Start small. Stay boring. Use it where it helps, ignore it where it doesn’t. That’s how working Java developers adopt tools that actually last.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ted Hagos</name></author><category term="Java" /><category term="AI" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Java veteran's guide to using AI coding tools without losing your mind.

This post is a curated snapshot of resources I’ve found genuinely useful over time.</p>

<h2 id="core-resources">Core resources</h2>

<h3 id="public-apisio">public-apis.io</h3>
<p>A directory of free and open APIs, grouped by category. Ideal for learning, demos, interview exercises, or quick prototypes where standing up a backend would be overkill.</p>

<h3 id="drawkitio">drawkit.io</h3>
<p>Clean, modern illustrations that work well for landing pages, blog headers, and lightweight product mockups. A solid alternative to generic stock imagery.</p>

<h3 id="cssgg">css.gg</h3>
<p>A lightweight icon library built entirely with CSS. Useful when you want icons without pulling in a large dependency or managing SVGs.</p>

<h2 id="newer-additions">Newer additions</h2>

<h3 id="roadmapsh">roadmap.sh</h3>
<p>A practical set of learning roadmaps for developers — frontend, backend, DevOps, Android, and more. Especially useful for self-learners and mentors who want a structured reference without fluff.</p>

<h3 id="freecodecamporg">freeCodeCamp.org</h3>
<p>Still one of the best free learning platforms around. The curriculum, articles, and long-form tutorials make it a strong supplement to formal courses or self-paced study.</p>

<h3 id="ai-assisted-coding-tools">AI-assisted coding tools</h3>
<p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and similar systems are increasingly useful for boilerplate, refactoring, and exploration. Best treated as assistants, not authorities — they amplify skill, not replace it.</p>

<h3 id="excalidraw">Excalidraw</h3>
<p>A simple diagramming tool that’s perfect for system design sketches, architecture discussions, and teaching explanations. Low friction and easy to share.</p>

<h3 id="regex101">Regex101</h3>
<p>An excellent playground for writing, testing, and explaining regular expressions. Especially useful when mentoring or debugging edge cases.</p>

I created this project using Android Studio 4 (Canary version, at the time of writing). Below are the project details;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name of project</strong>. My Application</li>
  <li><strong>MIN SDK</strong>. Android 10, API level 29</li>
  <li><strong>Form factor</strong>. Phone and Tablet</li>
  <li><strong>Language</strong>. Java</li>
</ul>

<p>You can add a Button View object to the layout file either in Design Mode or in Code View. The Code View of <strong>/app/res/activity_main.xml</strong>, with the Button View added, looks like the following</p>

<p><strong>Listing 1. /app/res/activity_main.xml</strong></p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want the Button to do something interesting when it’s clicked, you need to do the following;</p>

<ol>
  <li>In <strong>MainActivity.java</strong>, get a programmatic reference to the Button View object</li>
  <li>Still in MainActivity, create a listener object (a ClickListener object)</li>
  <li>Override the onClick method of the ClickListener object</li>
  <li>Bind the listener object to the Button object</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First step</strong> is to get a reference to the Button object. You can do this with the findViewById() method, like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.***button\***);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You need to pass the resource <strong>ID</strong> as an argument to this method; the resource ID of the button is R.id.button. The <strong>R.java</strong> file is generated by the Android Runtime during compilation so we can use it to reference the View objects in the layout files.</p>

<p><strong>Second step</strong> is to create a listener object. Since we want the Button to react to click events, we will create an OnClickListener object, like this</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">View</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">OnClickListener</span> <span class="n">listener</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="k">new</span><span class="o">**</span> <span class="nc">View</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">OnClickListener</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="o">**</span><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">onClick</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">View</span> <span class="n">view</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// statements;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Third step</strong> it override the onClick method on the OnClickListener object. Whatever you want to happen when the button is clicked, you should put it inside this method.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth step</strong> is to bind the listener object to the Button object, like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>btn.setOnClickListener(listener);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you can run the application. Test it either in the emulator (AVD) or a connected device. The app looks like this</p>

We won’t go into detail; that’s not the goal, but rather just to show you what’s available in Android Studio.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="import-samples">Import Samples</h2>

<p>One way to boost your productivity and save time is to learn how to create things and discover how they work in Android Studio. The  <strong>Import Sample</strong> feature can save you a lot of time. You can get to this feature from the main menu bar of Android Studio, choose <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Import Sample</strong>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/import-sample-1.png" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1. Import Sample</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What you see in figure 1 above is a list of code samples you can either browse or create as a local project.</p>

<p>Let’s say I’d like to learn something about the Autofill Framework — like what you see you in figure 1, you can see a preview of what it looks like, and you can also click on the “Browse in GitHub” link.  When you click <em>Next</em>, you’ll see dialog that’s somewhat similar to when creating a new project, as shown in figure 2.</p>

<figure style="width: 40rem; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto">
  <img src="/images/import-sample-2.png" />
  <figcaption> Figure 2. Import Sample, next Window</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you click “Finish” on “Import Sample” dialog, Android Studio will create a new project locally and download the sample file from GitHub so you can take a closer look at it and work on right away.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>

<p>Refactoring is basically rewriting and improving your source code without creating new functionality; this practice helps keep the code SOLID, DRY (don’t repeat yourself) and hence, easier to maintain.</p>

<aside>
<strong>NOTE.</strong> I spelled SOLID in all caps because it’s also an acronym which stands for <strong>S</strong>ingle Responsibility, <strong>O</strong>pen Closed Principle, <strong>L</strong>iskov Principle, <strong>I</strong>nterface Segregation and <strong>D</strong>ependency Inversion Principle — these are principles for object oriented design which was popularized by Robert C. Martin
</aside>

<p>Android Studio has some nifty refactoring capabilities. It’s easy to get started, just select a piece of code that you’d like to refactor, then use the context sensitive right-click, as shown in figure 3. Alternatively, you can also use the keyboard shortcuts — CTRL + T for macOS and CTRL + Alt + Shift + T if you’re on Windows/Linux.</p>

<figure style="width: 40rem; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto">
  <img src="/images/refactor.png" />
  <figcaption>Figure 3. Refactor</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m sure you’ve done refactoring many times before, but let’s just jog our memories here.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rename. This will let you safely rename variables and other identifiers etc. You should use this instead of Find and Replace.  This works across the entire project, and not only in the current file</li>
  <li>Change Signature. This will let you change a method, either its name or the parameters. It also works at a class level e.g. you can turn a class into a generic type and manipulate the type parameters</li>
  <li>Move. Move an element; you can move a method to another class if you want to</li>
  <li>Copy. Let’s you copy elements e.g. currently selected class</li>
  <li>Safe Delete. If you need to delete something, Android Studio will verify that what you’re deleting isn’t in use by anything else in the code base. If it is in use, you’ll be prompted so you can address those things before you actually delete something important</li>
  <li>Extract Constant. Avoid using hard-coded values — you shouldn’t, you know it and you know why. The Extract option for refactoring works not only for constants, you can extract fields, methods, superclasses, variable, parameter and interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty more options in the Refactor menu; make sure to check the others out.</p>

<h2 id="generate">Generate</h2>

<p>Another time-saving feature of Android Studio is the code generator; it’s aptly named because it does exactly what you think it does — it generates code. Let’s take an example; figure 4 shows the keyboard cursor inside a class definition, while the cursor is within the class body, launch the Generator action; from the main menu bar, go to <strong>Code &gt; Generate</strong>.</p>

<figure style="margin: 1.5rem;">
  <img src="/images/code-generate.png" style="margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto;" />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 4. Generate Code
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, you can generate quite a lot of boiler-plate code. When you choose any of the Generate options, Android Studio will generate a generalized stub of code. Let’s choose the getter and setter option, shall we? Let’s say I have a PersonTest class, as shown in figure 8-5, while the keyboard cursor is still within the PersonTest class, go to the main menu bar, then Code &gt; Generate — alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command + N (macOS) or Alt + Insert (Windows and Linux); then choose to generate Getter and Setter. You’ll see the generate setters and getters dialog, as shown in figure 5.</p>

<figure style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <img src="/images/generate-getters-setters.png" style="margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto;" />
  <figcaption>Figure 5. Generate getters and setters</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The generator dialog shows all the autodetected fields in our class. It shows us the mFirstname and mLastname member variables; it also lets you do multiple selection. Select both member variables and click OK. Listing 1 shows the PersonTest class after code generation.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 1. PersonTest class</strong></p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PersonTest</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">;</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="nf">getmFirstname</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setmFirstname</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">mFirstname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="nf">getmLastname</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setmLastname</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">mLastname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">PersonTest</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">mFirstname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">mLastname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pretty neat already. Anything that lets us save on keystrokes is a good thing. I’m guessing you probably have just one thing to nitpick on this example; the method naming isn’t right. You probably would prefer to call** setLastname()** rather than <strong>setmLastname()</strong> don’t you? We’ll fix that in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="coding-styles">Coding Styles</h2>

<p>If you go to Android Studio’s Preferences or Settings, then go to Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Java, you’ll find that there’s plenty of things you can change about how the editor behaves. Figure 8-7 shows the options for the Code Style, specifically the Java language.</p>

<figure style="width: 40rem; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <img src="/images/coding-styles.png" />
  <figcaption> figure 6. Preferences &gt; Code Style &gt; Java</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you want to change the number of spaces for tabs and indents, you can do that in the Tabs and Indents area; be sure to check out the other options in this dialog. What I’d like to do, is to go to the Code Generation tab (shown in figure 7).</p>

<figure style="width: 40rem; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <img src="/images/code-generation.png" />
  <figcaption> figure 7. Code Generation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is where we can tell Android Studio how we name our variables. If you go back to listing 1, you’ll notice that I’d like to prefix my variables with <em>m</em>, like <strong>mLastname</strong> and <strong>mFirstname</strong>; initially, Android Studio didn’t know about it, that’s why when I generated some getters and setters for the member vars, it gave us <strong>setmLastname()</strong> instead of just <strong>setLastname()</strong>.</p>

<aside>
<strong>NOTE.</strong> Prefixing a member variable with m comes from AOSP (Android Open Source Project). I used it here because quite a lot of sample codes you will read online uses this convention. You can further read about it at <a href="https://bit.ly/styleguideaosp">Android Open Source Project</a> 
</aside>

<p>To tell Android Studio that I prefix my variables with m, I’ll put the m in Name Prefix for Field; as shown in figure 6. Click OK when you’re done.</p>

<p>Now, if I generate some getters and setters, we’ll get the more appropriate method names. Listing 2 shows the re-generated code for PersonTest class.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 2. PersonTest, regenerated</strong></p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PersonTest</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">;</span>

    <span class="n">mLastname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lastname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">PersonTest</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mFirstname</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">mLastname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mLastname</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="live-templates">Live Templates</h2>

<p>Another time-saver in Android Studio are Live Templates, it works a lot like those text expander applications, if you have used some of them. The basic idea is when you type a series of characters e.g. <em>datetoday</em>, then the editor will replace it with the text of the actual date today — that’s how live templates work.</p>

<p>If you’ve done some Android programming in the past, you’ve probably made this mistake at least once;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "no show");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is easy enough to spot, but some other errors may not be as obvious. Anyway, live templates can help you avoid these hassles. Live templates are shortcuts that are displayed as code-completion options; for example, try typing <strong>fbc</strong> inside an <strong>OnClick</strong> handler (or any event handler), as shown in figure 8.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/live-template-sample.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />
  <figcaption>Figure 8. Live Template Sample</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You’ll see the code completion options. Try to press the TAB key and see what happens.</p>

<p>Here are some common built-in templates; as listed in table 1.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1. Common Live Templates</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Abbreviation</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Code</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>fbc</td>
      <td>Find view by ID with cast</td>
      <td>($cast$)  findViewById(R.id.$resId$);</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>const</td>
      <td>Define an Android style constant</td>
      <td>private  static final int $name$ = $value$;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Toast</td>
      <td>Create a new Toast</td>
      <td>Toast.makeText($classname$.this,  “$text$”).show();</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fori</td>
      <td>Creates for loop</td>
      <td>for(int  $INDEX$ = 0;$INDEX$&lt;$LIMIT$;$INDEX++$ ) {   $END$  }</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Make sure you check out the other Live Templates, go to the Settings or Preferences window. If you’re on Windows or Linux, go to the main menu bar, then <strong>File &gt; Settings &gt; Editor &gt; Live Templates</strong>; if you’re on macOS, it’s at <strong>Android Studio &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Live Templates</strong> — you can even create your own Live Templates from there.</p>

<h2 id="important-keyboard-shortcuts">Important Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>The Android developer website maintains a page where you can find the keyboard shortcuts for Android Studio, it’s at http://bit.ly/androidstudiokbshortcuts. You should really make it a point to read that page; but before we close the chapter,  I’d like to leave you with 6 shortcuts that I find to be very useful for me — it could be useful for you too. Table 2 lists these shortcuts.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Shortcut</strong></th>
      <th><strong>What it does</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Press Shift  twice</strong></td>
      <td>It lets you search for a term everywhere. It searches assets  folder, gradle files, images resources, codes, xml configuration files etc.  If you don’t know which folder to search, just use this</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>CTRL +  Space  | Command + Space</strong></td>
      <td>Android Studio already has code completions and code  hinting; this is just a little extra. If you forgot the parameters for a  method that uses lots of parameters, you can use this to preview all the  variants of method and the corresponding parameters they expect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>ALT +  Insert  | Command + N</strong></td>
      <td>We’ve used this in the previous section where we generated  some code. This is the shortcut for the code generator</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>CTRL + O    | Command + O</strong></td>
      <td>When you want to override methods, use this shortcut</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>CTRL + -    | Command + -</strong></td>
      <td>You can use these to expand or collapse code blocks. It’s  handy to be able to fold codes when you’re working with a large codebase,  these shortcuts will make your life a bit easier when you fold/unfold blocks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>CTRL + Alt  + L | Command + Option + L</strong></td>
      <td>Don’t manually indent or re-indent your code — if you  messed up the indentation of a for loop or nested conditional blocks, just  highlight the code block and use this shortcut</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Rather than leave it empty, I’m turning it into a concise reference for APIs that game programmers tend to touch first when working on Android.</p>

<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a full game engine tutorial. Think of it as a mental map.</p>

<h2 id="core-building-blocks">Core building blocks</h2>

<h3 id="activity-and-lifecycle-apis">Activity and Lifecycle APIs</h3>
<p>Games on Android live inside an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>. Understanding lifecycle callbacks (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onCreate</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onPause</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onResume</code>) is critical, especially for handling interruptions like app switching, phone calls, or screen locks.</p>

<p>If your game ignores lifecycle events, it <em>will</em> behave badly on real devices.</p>

<h3 id="surfaceview-and-rendering">SurfaceView and rendering</h3>
<p>Most Android games start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SurfaceView</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TextureView</code> to get direct access to a drawing surface. These APIs allow you to manage your own render loop without fighting the standard UI thread.</p>

<p>This is usually where developers transition from “Android app” thinking to “game loop” thinking.</p>

<h3 id="canvas-and-basic-drawing">Canvas and basic drawing</h3>
<p>For 2D games, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Canvas</code> API is often enough:</p>
<ul>
  <li>drawing sprites and shapes</li>
  <li>handling simple animations</li>
  <li>prototyping mechanics quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t need OpenGL on day one.</p>

<h3 id="input-handling">Input handling</h3>
<p>Touch input (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onTouchEvent</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MotionEvent</code>) is the primary control mechanism on mobile. Games typically bypass standard widgets and work directly with raw input events for responsiveness.</p>

<p>Multi-touch support becomes important sooner than you expect.</p>

<h3 id="audio-apis">Audio APIs</h3>
<p>Short sound effects are commonly handled via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SoundPool</code>, while longer background tracks use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MediaPlayer</code>. Managing audio correctly — especially across lifecycle events — is one of the easiest places to introduce bugs.</p>

<h3 id="timing-and-game-loops">Timing and game loops</h3>
<p>Android doesn’t provide a “game loop” abstraction. Most games implement their own loop using a dedicated thread, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Choreographer</code>, or scheduled updates tied to frame rendering.</p>

<p>Consistency matters more than raw speed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-note-on-engines">A note on engines</h2>
<p>If you’re using a full game engine (Unity, LibGDX, etc.), many of these APIs are wrapped or abstracted away. Still, understanding what’s underneath helps when debugging performance, lifecycle issues, or platform-specific quirks.</p>

<hr />

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>node myapp.js "John Doe"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Any token (String or number) that’s passed after the name of the program file (myapp.js in this case) is a command line argument. If you want to pass more than one argument, simply separate them by space, like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>node myapp.js "John Doe" 1 2 3 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the command line arguments will be stored in the <strong>process.argv</strong> object; it’s an Array.  The 0th element contains the <em>node</em> executable itself, the 1st element is the name of JavaScript program; the 2nd element is the first command line parameter,  the 3rd element is the 2nd command line parameter, so on and so forth. So, in our example above, here’s what the <strong>process.argv</strong>  contains</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/Users/ted/.nvm/versions/node/v9.5.0/bin/node | process.argv[0]
/Users/ted/temp/cmdlineparams.js              | process.argv[1]
"John Doe"                                    | process.argv[2]
1                                             | process.argv[3]
2                                             | process.argv[4]
3                                             | process.argv[5]
4                                             | process.argv[6]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can process the command line arguments like this;</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">argv</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>   <span class="c1">// (1)</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/images/1.png" alt="" /> If the length of the array is greater than 2, we know that the user passed command line arguments. Remember that the first two elements of the array contains the node executable and the name of program file; so, the length of the <strong>process.argv</strong> array, is at a minimum, always 2. That’s why we’re checking for a value &gt; 2</p>

<p><img src="/images/2.png" alt="" /> We can use a simple <strong>for in</strong> loop to traverse the array</p>]]></content><author><name>Ted Hagos</name></author><category term="javascript" /><category term="node" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can pass an argument to a Node app like this]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Event Handling in Android</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/java/android/2020/04/23/event-handling-android.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Event Handling in Android" /><published>2020-04-23T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-04-23T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/java/android/2020/04/23/event-handling-android</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/java/android/2020/04/23/event-handling-android.html"><![CDATA[<p>The user interacts with an app by touching, clicking, swiping or typing something.  The Android framework captures, stores, processes and sends these actions to the app as event objects. The diagram (figure 1) below summarizes these interactions</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/android-event-handling.png" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1. Android Event Handling Overview</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can make the app respond these to events by doing the following;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a listener object that’s appropriate for the event you want the app to react to; if you want to respond to a click event, then use an the <strong>OnClickListener</strong> object. If you want to react to long clicks, you can use <strong>OnLongClickListener</strong></li>
  <li>Override the abstract methods of the listener. In case of the <strong>OnClickListener</strong>, the abstract method you need to override is the <strong>onClick()</strong> method</li>
  <li>Bind the listener object to a View object, like a Button; Figure 2 shows an annotated diagram on how this might look in code</li>
</ol>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/android-event-model.png" />
  <figcaption>Figure 2. Android Event Model</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Assuming that in your project, you already have a Button object <strong>id</strong> of which is <em>button</em>, the following code gets a reference to the Button object</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Button</span> <span class="n">btn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Button</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">findViewById</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="no">R</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">button</span><span class="o">);</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we can create a listener object and bind the Button (<strong>btn</strong>) to that listener object, like this</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">btn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setOnClickListener</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">View</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">OnClickListener</span><span class="o">(){</span>  
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onClick</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">View</span> <span class="n">view</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>  
    <span class="c1">// statement;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onClick()</code> method, as shown in the code above, will be called whenever <strong>btn</strong> is clicked by the user; that’s where you should put program logic.</p>

<p>View objects, like <em>Buttons</em>, can be bound to other listeners; the table below shows some of the more common listener interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Creates a new Random object</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Creates a new random integers not greater than 100</p>

<p>Java’s Random class generates not only integers, it can also handle double, float, boolean etc., so,  make sure you check out the docs at  <a href="https://bit.ly/javautilrandom">java.util.Random docs page</a></p>

<p>Here’s a small sample on how to use the Random class in Java. The <strong>RandomNumber</strong> class has two methods named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getNumber()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createRandomNumber()</code>, it’s supposed to behave like a <em>Singleton</em> so, it’s designed to create a random number only once.</p>

<p>It can actually be much simpler than the above code; because in Kotlin, you don’t have to use <em>try-catch</em> if you don’t want to. Exception handling is optional. So, you write the code like this;</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> The vararg keyword lets us accept multiple parameter for
this function. In this example, we declared a function that has a typed
parameter; it’s generic. We didn’t have to declare it as generic in order to
work with variable arguments, we just chose to so that it can work with a
variety of types</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> This is a simple looping mechanism so that we can print each item in the argument</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> We can pass Ints, and we can pass as many as we want because manyParams accepts variable number of arguments</p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong> It works with Strings as well</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong> Like in Java, we can pass an array to a function that accepts variable arguments. We need to use spread operator * to unpack the array. It’s like passing the individual elements of the array one by one, manually</p>

<p><strong>(6)</strong> The split() member function will return an <em>ArrayList</em>, you can convert it to an <em>Array</em> , then use the spread operator so you can pass it to a <em>vararg</em> function</p>
