In a few hours, I will head to Asia Pacific College to give an introductory talk about Android applications development. I haven't been to APC for a very long time, and I haven't talked in front of a crowd for a very long time as well, much less give an introductory talk inside an auditorium---but no matter, I think all will be well. 

I think I will structure the talk like this;

**What is it**

A Linux based Operating System for mobile devices
Developed by OHA (Open Handset Alliance) led by Google Inc
A rich development platform for mobile applications
The timeline

* 2003 - Android Inc., was founded by Andy Rubin
* 2005 - Android Inc was Acquired by Google
* 2008 - Android v1.0
* 2009 - Android v1.1 
* 2009 - v1.5 (CupCake), v1.6 (Donut)
* 2009 - v2.0/2.1 (Eclair)
* 2010 - v2.2 (Froyo), v2.3 (GingerBread)
* 2011 - v3.0 (HoneyComb)
* 2011 - v4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

**Why bother**

Because of;

* 10 Billion apps downloaded
* Hundred thousand device activations per day
* 500,000 apps downloaded from Google Play (IOS has roughly same number)

**Pros of Android development**

* Low barrier to entry. Android SDK runs on Linux, OSX and Windows
* Volume. Lots of people are downloading apps
*( Easy to get started. Android apps are unlike enterprise apps, they have shorter  development time

**Things you need to get started**

* Android SDK (downloadable from developer.android.com)
* A development tool (Eclipse, NetBeans -- a programmerâ€™s editor will do)
* JDK 1.5 or 1.6
* Apache Ant
* Java programming background
