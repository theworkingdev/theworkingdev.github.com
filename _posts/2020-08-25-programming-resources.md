description: A list of programming resources
---


Every developer eventually builds a private list of “go-to” sites — tools you reach for when prototyping, teaching, validating an idea, or just trying to move faster without unnecessary ceremony. This post is a curated snapshot of resources I’ve found genuinely useful over time.

## Core resources

### public-apis.io
A directory of free and open APIs, grouped by category. Ideal for learning, demos, interview exercises, or quick prototypes where standing up a backend would be overkill.

### drawkit.io
Clean, modern illustrations that work well for landing pages, blog headers, and lightweight product mockups. A solid alternative to generic stock imagery.

### css.gg
A lightweight icon library built entirely with CSS. Useful when you want icons without pulling in a large dependency or managing SVGs.

## Newer additions

### roadmap.sh
A practical set of learning roadmaps for developers — frontend, backend, DevOps, Android, and more. Especially useful for self-learners and mentors who want a structured reference without fluff.

### freeCodeCamp.org
Still one of the best free learning platforms around. The curriculum, articles, and long-form tutorials make it a strong supplement to formal courses or self-paced study.

### AI-assisted coding tools
Tools like GitHub Copilot and similar systems are increasingly useful for boilerplate, refactoring, and exploration. Best treated as assistants, not authorities — they amplify skill, not replace it.

### Excalidraw
A simple diagramming tool that’s perfect for system design sketches, architecture discussions, and teaching explanations. Low friction and easy to share.

### Regex101
An excellent playground for writing, testing, and explaining regular expressions. Especially useful when mentoring or debugging edge cases.

I update this list only when a resource proves useful more than once — the real filter that matters.
