1. Via Snippage - This is not a specific application written for Google Tasks. It actually can produce an application out of any web page
2. While in Gmail (Of course!) - but I don't want to leave my Mail.app, so, no
3. Get a FireFox side bar, it's an add-on
4. In iGoogle, the GTasks is a gadget, or;
5. You can access the Google Tasks url directly. Hmmm, this can work. I can set the url of the browser to https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig, then set the browser full screen. I think this can really work
